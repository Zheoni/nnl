# Neural Network Language

## What is this

Language to describe and execute neural networks. Useful for learning, it is not meant to be fast. It is part of a college assignment to learn about grammars.

## How to use it

There is a manual that explains all the features and syntax of the language. The manual was originally written in spanish and aumatically translated to english, so there may be some errors.

> TL;DR: `./nn <program>`

There are examples in the `programs` directory.

The `nnl` directory is a python package that can be used to embed the language in other project, the `nn` executable is just a front end for the package.
